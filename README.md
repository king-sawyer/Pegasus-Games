Pegasus Games is a local board game shop that I was lucky enough to be allowed to create a website for.

This project was created using many different techniques in React including:

- React routing
- Using context to minimize prop drilling
- Utelizing render props to redirect the users location

### In addition to creating this client side application, I created a backend for this project utelizing Heroku to host a database used to store tables for product information and verified users.




This project is optimized for both mobile and web browsing.
